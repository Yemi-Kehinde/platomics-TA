Infrastructure Design Plan: Production Deployment at Platomics

Objective
To design an infrastructure plan that makes Kubernetes workloads publicly available in a production environment while prioritizing security, developer collaboration, and self-management capabilities.

Architecture Overview
The architecture will integrate the existing tech stack at Platomics, focusing on security, automation, and observability. This design will also ensure that developers have the tools to manage their applications efficiently through GitOps and CI/CD pipelines.

Key Components:
- Kubernetes Cluster: Managed and secured container orchestration platform.
- Ingress Management: Controlled access to services.
- GitOps Workflow: Developer-driven deployment processes.
- Security Measures: Enhanced security through Vault, RBAC, and network policies.
- Observability Tools: Monitoring and logging infrastructure.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Consistent and automated environment setup using Ansible and Terraform.

Detailed Architecture Components
1. Kubernetes Cluster
   - Platform: The cluster can be deployed on cloud providers like AWS or Azure, with an emphasis on using Kubernetes-native     storage solutions like Ceph.
   - Namespaces: Separate environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) with proper RBAC configurations to ensure isolation and security.

Container Storage Interface (CSI): Utilize CSI drivers with Ceph for dynamic storage provisioning.
2. Ingress Management
   - NGINX Ingress Controller: To handle external traffic, enforcing SSL/TLS termination with Let's Encrypt via cert-manager.
   - Flux: For continuous delivery, enabling automated reconciliation of desired state from Git repositories to the cluster.

3. GitOps Workflow
   - GitLab CI/CD: Use GitLab CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
   - Flux: Implement GitOps practices by syncing Kubernetes manifests from a Git repository, allowing developers to manage their workloads via pull requests.

4. Security Measures
   - Vault: Securely manage and inject secrets into applications running on Kubernetes.
   - RBAC: Enforce strict access control to Kubernetes resources, ensuring that only authorized personnel can make changes.
   - Network Policies: Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to control communication between pods, enhancing security within the cluster.

5. Observability Tools
   - Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring metrics and visualizing the performance of services.
   - Alertmanager: Integrated with Prometheus for alerting based on predefined thresholds.
   - Centralized Logging: Use Fluentd to aggregate logs, store them in Elasticsearch, and visualize them in Kibana.

6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   - Terraform: Manage cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes resources in a declarative manner.
   - Ansible: Automate configuration management and application deployment across environments.

Additional Services for Enhanced Productivity and Security
- Kubernetes Dashboard: Provide a visual interface for managing Kubernetes resources, useful for developers and operators.
- Service Mesh (e.g., Istio): For managing microservices communication, security, and observability.
- Cost Management Tools: Implement cost management tools like Kubecost to track and optimize resource usage.
- Automated Testing: Integrate automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality before deployment.
